# single pass

# Create empty hashable aux space having search O(1) and add elements of the input array on the traversal.

# lets say num = [a,b,C1,d,e,f,C2,h,]  and C1 + C2 == target
# when you reach C2, C1 would already be there in aux space and can be retrieved in O(1) by using eq: C1 = target - C2


def twoSum(nums, target):
    d = {}
    for i, n in enumerate(nums):
        m = target - n  # calculate what should be the compliment
        if m in d:
            return [d[m], i]
        else:
            d[n] = i
